# Predictive Process Monitoring - A Starter Package for Jupyter

The notebooks in this repository are part of the assignment in the course Advanced Process Mining and intended as a starter for building your own prediction models for predictive process monitoring. They can be used as:

* Cloud notebooks via MyBinder  
* Local stand-alone notebooks
* Local Dockerized notebooks

refer to the Installations \& Usage section below for usage instructions.

You may also refer to the PM4Py documentation on Machine Learning for further options or an alternative to this implementation:

The collection of notebooks is a *living document* and subject to change.

## Installation \& Usage

### Cloud notebooks via MyBinder

Click on the `launch binder` links for either the R or the Python notebook. You could also  use the [Google Colab service](https://colab.research.google.com/); however, you may need to prepare the Google Colab environment to have the respective packages installed (see standalone instructions).

### Local notebooks

#### Docker

Build a Docker image with the provided Dockerfile:

```
docker build -t fmannhardt/starter-predictive-process-monitoring .
```

And start the Docker container running Jupyter on [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888?token=processmining):

```
docker run --rm -ti -e JUPYTER_TOKEN=processmining -p 8888:8888 fmannhardt/starter-predictive-process-monitoring
```

or use the Jupyter Lab interface:

```
docker run --rm -ti -e JUPYTER_TOKEN=processmining -p 8888:8888 fmannhardt/starter-predictive-process-monitoring sh -c "jupyter lab --ip 0.0.0.0 --no-browser"
```

#### Standalone

You should be able to run the Jupyter notebooks directly in a Jupyter environment using:
```
jupyter lab
```

Please make sure to have installed the following requirements:

**Python**

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure to install GraphViz for the visualization. On Windows with Chocolately this should work:
```
choco install graphviz
```
Consult the [PM4Py documentation](https://pm4py.fit.fraunhofer.de/install) for further details for other environments.
